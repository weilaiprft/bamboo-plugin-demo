# Sample Bamboo Plugin

NOTE: use logger branch
created to update navigator plugin version.
this is deployment task, actually for build plan task as well, but we use it for deployment task

i have been using play with docker's atlassian sdk container to pull this logger branch and run atlas-run

Requirements include having the atlassian SDK installed.
https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/getting-started/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project


# Steps

(After install the Atlassian SDK)

1. From commandline run: *atlas-run*
2. Go to : localhost:6990/bamboo/
3. Default login is admin/admin
4. Plugin will be installed by default.

# Notes
For IntelliJ intellisense support (for all dependencies to properly resolve in the editor) .. you will need to manually add classpath (in IDE) to Bamboo lib directory at
/target/bamboo/webapp/lib   (these are the Bamboo jars that will be downloaded after the first succesfuly atlas-run execution).
